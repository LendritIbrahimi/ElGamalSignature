# ElGamal Encryption

The aim of this project is to extend the Microsoft **[.NET framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)** by implementing the ElGamal encryption algorithm.

By necessity the **C#** language was used for the implementation details of the algorithm and the Windows Forms (**WinForms**) library for the GUI side of the application.

## Cryptography

In cryptography, the **[ElGamal encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption)** system is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography.

A **[digital signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature)** is a mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software or digital document.

ElGamal encryption is used in the free **[GNU Privacy Guard](https://gnupg.org/)** software, recent versions of **[Pretty Good Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy)** (PGP), and other cryptosystems.

## Installation and Execution
To run this you can choose one of two paths:

1. Releases

-Go to https://github.com/kastriotsalihu1/elgamal-encryption/releases

-download the latest relase assets

-execute the **.exe** file, or

2. Visual Studio

-Download Visual Studio from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

-Download the source code

![Download the source code](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1svkjbWMWeZK4RJ9Q5mRAlzBr4gd3W-fT)

-Open the **.sln** in Visual Studio

-Build and Run project

## Usage

You can use this project to make a digital signature of a message.

![Home screen preview](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1DegfzsETtUZEaCHKfA6rj0qXY7cljIhL)

It has two primary modes of execution

1. Automatic
In this mode you just enter the message and the generation of the private and public keys and the prime number is automatic.

2. Manual
In this mode the message, the private key, the public key and the prime number needed for the algorithm must be set manually.
